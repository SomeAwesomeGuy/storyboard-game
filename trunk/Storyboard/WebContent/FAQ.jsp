		<i>How do you play this game?</i><br>
		This game is based on a simple drawing game called <a href="http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/30618/eat-poop-you-cat">Eat Poop You Cat</a>. 
		To start off, the first player clicks "Create Thread" on the left side of the main page. The player picks a title for the thread and writes a simple story.
		The next player can then see the thread and has the option to draw a picture of based on the story, by clicking the "Draw" link. 
		Once that player submits his drawing, a different player can write a story based on the drawing, by clicking the "Write" link.
		This can continue indefinitely, and the fun is in seeing where the story leads! Once a player has posted in a thread, he will be able to see the entire thread history.

		<i>Why is this site so ugly?</i><br>
		This was the best I could do with my lack of design sense and html experience. If you think you can do better, you're welcome to help!

		<i>I found a bug. Now what?</i><br>
		Kill it with your shoe. Don't miss. If it escapes, it may come back while you're sleeping.
